# Real Estate Price Prediction
#### This machine learning project predicts real estate prices in five cities of Pakistan: Faisalabad, Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Multan. The model uses data collected from Zameen.com through web scraping to predict prices based on user input of area, square footage, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Project Description
#### The real estate price prediction project is a semester project that uses machine learning to predict prices of properties in Pakistan. The project is designed to help people make informed decisions when buying or selling a property in any of the five cities. The model is built using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas.

#### The project involved web scraping data from Zameen.com to collect real estate data in the five cities. The data was preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. Feature engineering techniques were used to select the most relevant features and to transform the data into a format suitable for training the model. The model was trained using several regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on performance metrics.

## Getting Started
#### To use the real estate price prediction model, simply enter the area name, square footage, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms required, and the model will generate a prediction for the property price. The project code is available on GitHub and can be cloned or downloaded for local use.

#### Feel free to contribute to the project by improving the model or adding new features. For any questions or suggestions, please contact the project owner.
